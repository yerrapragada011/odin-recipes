    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked confection.
      Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey,
      depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always, have a glossy
      "skin" on their upper crust.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Eggs + Water</li>
      <li>Powdered Sugar</li>
      <li>Unsweetend Cocoa Powder</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
      <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong
          >First, mix together the day and wet ingredients in two seperate
          bowls.</strong
        >Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate
        chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive
        oil, and water in a large one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients.</strong>Sprinkle the
        dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter
        will be thick!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Then, pour the batter into an 8x8 inch baking pan lined with
          parchment paper.
        </strong>
        Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to
        smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick - that's ok.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finally, bake!</strong>Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and
        bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a
        few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before
        slicing and serving. Enjoy!
