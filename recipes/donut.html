    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      A doughnut or donut is a type of food made from leavened fried dough. It
      is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet
      snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food
      stalls, and franchised specialty vendors.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Yeast</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Butter</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h2>First the dough</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the dough.</strong> The dough comes together with a
        mixer. You can also make the dough by hand, but it requires a bit of arm
        muscle. After the dough comes together in the mixing bowl, knead it for
        5-7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Roll & cut into doughnuts.</strong> Roll the dough out to
        1/2-inch thickness. Cut the doughnuts using a 3-3.5-inch doughnut
        cutter. Line 1 or 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone
        baking mat. Place doughnuts (and doughnut holes!) onto the lined baking
        sheet(s), then lightly cover and allow to rest for 30 minutes as you
        heat the oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the oil.</strong> Using a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch
        oven and an oil thermometer, heat vegetable oil to 375°F (191°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fry the doughnuts.</strong>Working with 2-3 doughnuts at a time,
        cook for 1 minute on each side. Carefully remove from the oil and place
        onto prepared rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. (See my recipe note
        about making the doughnut holes.)Working with 2-3 doughnuts at a time,

    </ol>
    <h2>Now the glaze</h2>
    <p>
      Make a simple 3-ingredient glaze: just milk or cream, confectioners'
      sugar, and vanilla extract. This part couldn't be easier; literally just
      whisk the 3 ingredients together. Dunk each side of the warm doughnuts
      into the glaze. The glaze will set in about 20 minutes.
